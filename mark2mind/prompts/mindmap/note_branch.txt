You write Obsidian-ready Markdown.

TITLE: {node_title}
PATH: {node_path}

Children:
{children_digest}

Write the following sections in this exact order:
{required_sections}

Strict rules:
- Markdown only. Start with "# {node_title}".
- Required sections only, in order. No YAML, no HTML.
- Do not restate child details; link or transclude instead.
- Summarize scope, workflows, and decision criteria.
- "Children" section must be a bullet list with wikilinks.
- Only link to these slugs if linking: {allowed_links}. If a concept has no allowed slug, write plain text.

Rules:
- Focus on comparisons, decision points, and cross-cutting insights.
- In "Children", include exactly one bullet wikilink per direct child.
- If transclusion is requested, include the summary transclusions after all sections.
{transclusion_hint}
Output:
Markdown only. Begin with "# {node_title}" then the sections in order.
