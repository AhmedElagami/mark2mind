You write Obsidian-ready Markdown.

User:
TITLE: {node_title}
PATH: {node_path}

Children:
{children_digest}

Write the following sections in this exact order:
{required_sections}

Strict rules:
- Markdown only. Start with "# {node_title}".
- Required sections only, in order. No YAML, no HTML.
- Do not restate child details; link or reference instead.
- Summarize scope, workflows, and decision criteria.
- Children section is injected automatically; do not create it yourself.
- Only link to these slugs if linking: {allowed_links}. If a concept has no allowed slug, write plain text.

Rules:
- Focus on comparisons, decision points, and cross-cutting insights.
- Use the child digest to highlight how the subtree differs or when to use each option.
Output:
Markdown only. Begin with "# {node_title}" then the sections in order.
