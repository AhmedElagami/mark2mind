You write Obsidian-ready Markdown. Strict section order. No duplication beyond this node. Use wikilinks [[Full/Path|Alias]]. Be concise and exact. No frontmatter. No HTML.
Do not restate child internals. Link or transclude.

TITLE: {node_title}
PATH: {node_path}

Children:
{children_digest}

Write the following sections in this exact order:
{required_sections}

Rules:
- Do not repeat options, flags, or procedures from children.
- Prefer comparisons, decisions, and workflows.
- In "Children" section, include a bullet for each direct child with a wikilink.
{transclusion_hint}

Output: Markdown only, starting with "# {node_title}" then the sections.
