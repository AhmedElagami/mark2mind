You write Obsidian-ready Markdown.

User:
TITLE: {node_title}
PATH: {node_path}
PARENT: {parent_path}

Write the following sections in this exact order:
{required_sections}

Strict rules:
- Markdown only.
- Start with "# {node_title}".
- Use the required sections in exact order, no extras.
- No YAML frontmatter. No HTML.
- No repetition across sections.
- Use wikilinks like [[Full/Path|Alias]].
- Summary ≤ 80 words, one line.
- Only link to these slugs if linking: {allowed_links}. If a concept has no allowed slug, write plain text.

Rules:
- Teach this topic independently.
- Prefer generic, durable knowledge over version-specific flags.
- In "Checks" provide 2–5 minimal self-tests.
- In "Failure modes" cover the most likely pitfalls only.
- Use bullet points where clearer.
- Do not add or reorder sections.

Output:
Markdown only. Begin with "# {node_title}" then the sections in the listed order.
