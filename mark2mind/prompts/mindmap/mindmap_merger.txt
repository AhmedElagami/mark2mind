You are a **semantic mindmap refactorer and merger**.

Your task is to **merge two concept hierarchies** — `tree_a` and `tree_b` — into a single, unified semantic structure.

This mindmap will be used for **deep learning, visual organization, and review** of technical knowledge.

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

* **Merge** both trees into one clean, conceptually grouped hierarchy
* Eliminate redundancy
* Optimize node grouping and naming for clarity and structure

---

## 🧠 RULES

1. **Use only** the concepts present in `tree_a` and `tree_b`
2. You **may restructure** freely for semantic optimization:

   * ✅ Rename vague or redundant titles
   * ✅ Merge duplicate or overlapping concepts
   * ✅ Split overloaded nodes into clearer subtopics
   * ✅ Move nodes under better semantic parents
   * ✅ Reorder nodes for logical learning flow

3. **Node formatting standards**:

   * `"title"`: short, clear concept label (2–6 words)
   * `"children"`: nested subtopics or components (empty array if none)
   * ❌ No copied summaries, markdown, or metadata

---

## 🔁 STRATEGY

* Focus on **semantic clarity and grouping**, not original order
* Treat similar or identical topics from both trees as mergeable
* Ensure that each node fits logically into the final structure

---

## 📦 INPUT

You are given:

* `tree_a`: a structured concept hierarchy (JSON)
* `tree_b`: another concept hierarchy to merge in (JSON)

---

## ✅ OUTPUT FORMAT

Return the final, merged mindmap tree in this format:

```json
{
  "root": "Main Topic",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "title": "Refactored or Merged Concept",
      "children": [
        { "title": "Subtopic A" },
        { "title": "Subtopic B" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
````

* ✅ Rename or reorder nodes freely
* ✅ Maintain clear conceptual hierarchy and consistency
* ❌ Do not include summaries, copied content, or metadata

### 🌲 TREE A

```json
{tree_a}
```

---

### 🌲 TREE B

```json
{tree_b}
```
