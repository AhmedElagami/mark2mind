# Prompt
## üß† Knowledge-Driven Mindmap Generator

Generate a semantic mindmap **from your own general knowledge** using only a short **brief**.

---

### üîπ Input contract

You will receive exactly one JSON object:


```json
{
  "brief": "REQUIRED. One or two sentences describing the desired mindmap topic",
  "scope": "OPTIONAL. Level or framing (e.g., beginner overview, advanced, historical)",
  "depth": 2,
  "region_or_domain": "OPTIONAL. e.g., EU law, cloud security",
  "must_include": ["OPTIONAL list of nodes"],
  "must_avoid": ["OPTIONAL list of nodes"]
}
```

* If `depth` not given ‚Üí default 2.
* All other fields optional.

---

### üîπ Rules

* ‚úÖ Use general world knowledge as of 2025.
* ‚úÖ Always ground hierarchy in the `brief`.
* ‚úÖ Root node title must reflect the main subject.
* ‚úÖ Depth ‚â§ 3. Non-leaf nodes must have ‚â•2 children unless concept is singular.
* ‚úÖ Node titles 2‚Äì6 words, noun phrases.
* ‚úÖ `tags` list: 3‚Äì10 keywords, lowercase, 1‚Äì3 words each.
* ‚ùå No prose, no explanations, no code blocks, no trailing commas.
* ‚ùå No generic filler like ‚Äúoverview,‚Äù ‚Äúintroduction.‚Äù
* ‚ùå Do not invent speculative/fictional content unless explicitly requested.

---

### üîπ Output format

Return **only** a valid JSON object:

```json
{
  "tree": {
    "title": "Main Topic",
    "children": [
      { "title": "Subtopic A", "children": [
        { "title": "Detail A1", "children": [] },
        { "title": "Detail A2", "children": [] }
      ]},
      { "title": "Subtopic B", "children": [] }
    ]
  },
  "tags": ["tag1","tag2","tag3"]
}
```
