# Chapter 1  
Hi, I‚Äôm the author, follow me on Twitter @dev123!  
This chapter covers how memory works.  

Memory is where data is stored.  

```python
x = [1,2,3]
print(x)
```  

Lots more on this in Chapter 9.

**Output**

````json
{
  "markdown": "# Chapter 1\n\nMemory is where data is stored.\n\n```python\nx = [1,2,3]\nprint(x)\n```"
}
