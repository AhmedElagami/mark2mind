# Markdown Cleaner Feature

# Mindmap Refinement Feature

You basically have a nested JSON tree (a mindmap) with titles, children, and optional `content_refs`, and you want to refine it in a step-by-step, human-in-the-loop process using a prompt.

The “best” way to traverse and refine it depends on **how granular you want edits** and **whether you want to preserve context** while reviewing.
Here are multiple approaches you could take:

---

### **1. Depth-First Search (DFS) Sequential Refinement**

**How it works:**

* Start at the root, process each node fully before moving to siblings.
* For each node:

  * Show its title, content\_refs, and possibly its path in the tree for context.
  * Ask the refinement prompt (remove irrelevant text, rewrite, restructure).
  * Apply changes and move down to children.

**Pros:**

* Maintains maximum context because you process parent before children.
* Works well if child meaning depends on the parent.

**Cons:**

* Might be slow for very large trees because you can’t parallelize well.
* Repeated context might feel redundant.

**Use case:** Good if refinements often depend on understanding the parent’s scope.

---

### **2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) Layer-by-Layer Pass**

**How it works:**

* Start at the root, process all nodes at the same depth together.
* Example: First just clean up all top-level section titles, then go deeper.

**Pros:**

* Easy to maintain a high-level outline before diving into details.
* You can “prune” whole branches early if irrelevant.

**Cons:**

* Children may still contain text inconsistent with newly edited parents until later passes.

**Use case:** Good if you want to restructure the hierarchy before rewriting content.

---

### **3. Path-Context Iteration**

**How it works:**

* For each node, send the entire **path from root to that node** plus its content to the refinement step.
* This way, the model sees exactly where in the mindmap this belongs.

**Pros:**

* Keeps edits consistent with topic scope.
* Easier to remove out-of-place content.

**Cons:**

* Prompt size grows with depth.
* More tokens per step.

**Use case:** Ideal when refining in isolation would lose important context.

---

### **4. Multi-Pass Refinement**

**How it works:**

* Pass 1: Structural cleanup (remove misplaced nodes, re-arrange hierarchy).
* Pass 2: Content trimming (remove irrelevant content\_refs).
* Pass 3: Rewriting & polishing.

**Pros:**

* Focuses on one kind of change at a time → less cognitive overload.
* Can automate some passes.

**Cons:**

* Requires multiple traversals.
* Slightly more work than single-pass.

**Use case:** Best for high-quality output across many trees.

---

### **5. Hybrid: BFS Outline Pass → DFS Detailed Pass**

**How it works:**

1. BFS pass to confirm the main structure and prune branches.
2. DFS pass to refine content in detail.

**Pros:**

* Early pass ensures structure is clean before spending effort on text.
* Final pass ensures context accuracy.

**Cons:**

* Two passes, so slower than pure DFS.

**Use case:** Best when your mindmaps have both structural and textual noise.

---

### **6. Interactive “Node-by-Node Approval” Mode**

**How it works:**

* Present one node (title + content) at a time.
* Ask user/model: “Keep as-is, edit, move, or delete?”
* Apply changes immediately.

**Pros:**

* Full control, minimal risk of accidental loss.
* You can skip trivial nodes quickly.

**Cons:**

* Very manual.
* Not scalable without batching.

**Use case:** Best for high-value or small trees where accuracy matters more than speed.

---

### **Recommendation for Your Case**

Given your goal is **slow, careful, iterative refinement** across multiple trees, I’d suggest:

**Step 1 (Outline Pass – BFS)**

* Go layer by layer, clean up structure & remove obviously wrong branches.
* This will drastically reduce junk before you start polishing.

**Step 2 (Content Pass – DFS with Path Context)**

* For each remaining node, provide:

  * The **path** from root to this node.
  * The node’s title + content\_refs.
  * Prompt to rewrite, trim, or delete content.

**Step 3 (Final Sweep)**

* One quick DFS pass to ensure style consistency and no leftover placeholders.

---

If you want, I can also draft a **sample refinement prompt template** that would work for **both structure cleanup and content polishing** in this JSON format.
That way you can plug it into any of the traversal methods above.


Great question. Here’s a pragmatic “what to cut” pass over your mindmap, mapped to the **3-stage workflow** I suggested (BFS outline → DFS content → final sweep). I’m assuming the goal is an objective, reusable primer that avoids meta, filler, promo, and duplication.

# Stage 1 — Outline pass (BFS): prune irrelevant/out-of-scope branches & obvious junk

Cut entire nodes/blocks that don’t belong in a reusable technical mindmap.

* **`Miscellaneous > Chapter Summary` (entire subtree)**
  *Why:* Meta/book-only scaffolding. Not useful in a stand-alone primer mindmap.

* **`Miscellaneous > Naming and Logo > Star Trek Reference`**
  *Why:* Trivia; not helpful for learning core K8s.

* **Root-level `content_refs` that look like chapter scaffolding**

  * “This chapter gets you up-to-speed…”
  * “Important Kubernetes background”
    *Why:* Book meta, not domain knowledge.

* **`Miscellaneous` root `content_refs` with contact/promotional info**

  * “Don’t be afraid… you can reach me at…”, LinkedIn/BlueSky/X/Web/Email
    *Why:* Personal promo/PII; breaks reuse across trees.

* **Empty, aimless leaves that aren’t part of your intended outline** (if you don’t plan to fill them)

  * `Historical Context > Industry Evolution > Industry Needs` (empty)
  * Consider pruning any other **empty** leaf that isn’t an intentional placeholder.
    *Why:* Noise during refinement; keep only if you’ll definitely populate.

# Stage 2 — Content pass (DFS with path context): trim filler, meta, cross-refs, placeholders, and duplicates

Keep the nodes, but remove or rewrite these **content\_refs** (sentences) inside them.

* **Core Concepts > Orchestration**

  * “**Lots more**.” → **Remove** (pure filler).
  * “**The best part… sit back and let Kubernetes work its magic.**” → **Rewrite or cut** (colloquial, promotional tone).
  * “**The original sentence read; … We now know this means:** …” → **Remove** (editorial/meta commentary).

* **Technical Architecture > Container Runtime**

  * “**Figure 1.2 shows…**” and “**You’ll work with this in Chapter 9…**” → **Remove** (cross-chapter references; not portable).

* **Technical Architecture > Kubernetes as Cloud OS**

  * Duplicative statements:

    * “**Kubernetes: the Operating System of the cloud**” (title-like)
    * “**Kubernetes is the de facto platform … we sometimes call it the operating system (OS) of the cloud.**”
    * “**One of the main things an OS does…**” / “**Kubernetes does a similar thing…**”
    * “**As a quick example, you can schedule applications …**” and the two bullets under **Cloud Enablers** that restate the same.
      → **Consolidate** to one crisp definition + one example; **remove** the rest to avoid repetition.

* **Microservices > E-commerce Example**

  * The **image placeholder** `![Image](media/figure1-4.png)` → **Remove** (dangling asset).
  * The list items are fine; keep if you want a concrete example.

* **Containerization > Container vs VM**

  * Fine overall. If brevity is a goal, the second paragraph’s last sentence (“**But containers are the first-choice solution for most new applications.**”) can be seen as assertive; either **keep** (if you want opinionated) or **tone down**.

* **Containerization > Container Runtime Interface (CRI)**

  * Good, but mildly marketingy: “**pick and choose the best runtimes**” → **Tighten** (neutral tone).

* **Historical Context > Origins**

  * “**Kubernetes was developed… partly in response to AWS and Docker.**” → **Weaken or remove** if you want to avoid contentious causality; keep neutral (“Developed at Google; influenced by internal systems and containerization trends.”).
  * “**It runs on any cloud or on-prem… allows you to build hybrid clouds, …**” → Some of this repeats the “Cloud OS” section; **dedupe** (keep in one place).
  * “**open-sourced under Apache 2.0 and owned by CNCF**” → Keep (factual), but **strip timeline hype** (“now the industry standard…”) if you want strictly neutral tone.

* **Historical Context > Origins > CNCF Donation**

  * “**As things stand… version 1.32 and averaging three new releases per year**” → **Remove or move to ‘timeline’ node**; this goes stale fast. Keep just “Apache 2.0; CNCF; initial release July 2015.”

* **Technical Architecture > Kubernetes as Cloud OS > Cloud Enablers**

  * Leaf nodes (`Hybrid cloud`, `Multi-cloud`, `Cloud migrations`) whose **content\_ref just repeats the title** → **Remove those content\_refs** (redundant) or replace with one-line definitions.

# Stage 3 — Final sweep: style, formatting, and minor cleanups

* Remove odd formatting: `[{.underline}]` and similar inline styling artifacts.
* Normalize terminology (e.g., “microservices applications” → “microservice applications”).
* Ensure tense/voice consistency and avoid second person (“you”) unless it’s a teaching style choice.

---

## Quick checklist (TL;DR)

* **Remove**: promo/contact block; chapter scaffolding; “Lots more”; “work its magic”; “original sentence read”; figure/chapter references; image placeholder; stale version cadence; redundant “OS of the cloud” sentences; empty leaves you won’t fill; trivia (Star Trek).
* **Trim/dedupe**: Cloud OS explanations; hybrid/multi-cloud repetitions; strong causal claims in history; mild marketing tone.
* **Keep (good signal)**: clear definitions, concise lists (e-commerce microservices), CRI purpose (lightly toned), Docker→containerd transition (sans styling artifacts).

If you want, I can apply these cuts to your JSON and return a **cleaned version** that reflects exactly this Stage-1 & Stage-2 removal, so you have a baseline before you start rewriting.

Short answer: yes—use a **separate prompt per phase**. Each phase has a different goal and different rules of engagement, so giving the model a tight, purpose-built prompt (and output schema) per phase keeps it accurate, fast, and easier to automate across many trees.

Below are ready-to-use templates and output contracts you can drop into your pipeline.

---

# Stage 1 — Outline pass (BFS): structure & pruning

**Goal:** Fix the tree shape; remove obviously out-of-scope/meta nodes; mark empty/useless leaves; suggest moves/merges.
**Input per batch:** A *level* of nodes (titles + node\_ids + shallow context like parent path). Avoid long `content_refs` here—only first 1–2 lines if needed.

### Prompt template

```
SYSTEM
You are a strict structural editor for mindmap JSON. Do not rewrite content. Only make structural decisions.

USER
You will receive:
- A path: root ➜ … ➜ {current parent title}
- An array of child nodes for that parent (title, node_id, has_children, has_content_refs, first_120_chars_of_first_content_ref if present)

TASK
For each child node, decide one action:
- KEEP            (node is in-scope and well-placed)
- DELETE          (node is meta/promo/filler/out-of-scope)
- MOVE            (node is in-scope but belongs under a different existing node)
- MERGE_INTO      (node is duplicate/near-duplicate; merge its content into target)
- FLAG_EMPTY      (keep but mark as TODO if intentionally blank; otherwise DELETE)

RULES
- Out-of-scope examples: author contact info, chapter scaffolding (“This chapter…”, “Figure…”, “Chapter 9…”), trivia (e.g., Star Trek references), stale version cadence.
- Do not invent new nodes. Only refer to existing node_ids.
- If MOVE or MERGE_INTO, provide a ranked list of 1–3 candidate target node_ids with a short reason.
- Be conservative: prefer KEEP over DELETE when unsure, but use FLAG_EMPTY for empty leaves.
- No content rewriting in this phase.

OUTPUT (JSON)
{
  "decisions": [
    {
      "node_id": "…",
      "action": "KEEP|DELETE|MOVE|MERGE_INTO|FLAG_EMPTY",
      "targets": ["optional_target_id1","optional_target_id2"],
      "reason": "short, specific"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

# Stage 2 — Content pass (DFS with path context): trimming & polishing

**Goal:** Within kept nodes, remove filler/meta/duplicates, neutralize tone, and tighten `content_refs`.
**Input per node:** Full path (root → … → node), node title, sibling titles, this node’s `content_refs` (markdown + element\_id), and (optional) a short “parent summary” from Stage 1 so the model understands scope.

### Prompt template

```
SYSTEM
You are a technical editor. Tighten content without changing the factual scope. No structural moves here.

USER
CONTEXT
- Path: root ➜ … ➜ {this node title}
- Siblings: [{titles}]
- Parent summary (optional): {one-paragraph summary}

NODE
{
  "title": "...",
  "node_id": "...",
  "content_refs": [
    {"element_id":"...","markdown":"..."},
    ...
  ]
}

TASK
Edit ONLY the content of this node:
- Remove meta/promotional text, author contact, chapter/figure cross-refs, stale version cadence, and filler ("Lots more", "work its magic").
- De-duplicate ideas already present in parent/siblings.
- Keep neutral tone; remove second-person instructional fluff unless essential.
- Preserve valid facts; do not introduce any new claims.

For each content_ref:
- ACTION: KEEP | REWRITE | DELETE
- If REWRITE, provide concise replacement markdown (≤ 2–3 sentences per ref unless a list).
- If a content_ref is just a duplicate of the title, DELETE it.
- Do not touch structure or children.

OUTPUT (JSON)
{
  "node_id": "...",
  "edits": [
    {
      "element_id": "...",
      "action": "KEEP|REWRITE|DELETE",
      "markdown": "only if action=REWRITE"
    }
  ],
  "notes": "optional short note about what you removed and why",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}
```

**Tip:** If a node’s content repeats material elsewhere (e.g., multiple “OS of the cloud” blurbs), include a `seen_claims` array you build during traversal and pass it in as context to help the model dedupe.

---

# Stage 3 — Final sweep: style & consistency

**Goal:** Uniform voice, formatting, terminology, and link/style artifacts.
**Input per batch:** Concatenated, *already-trimmed* `content_refs` for a subtree (e.g., one major section at a time), plus a **style guide**.

### Mini style guide (edit to taste)

* Voice: neutral, concise, third person.
* Terminology: “microservice application”, not “microservices application”.
* No second person (“you”) unless describing an operator workflow.
* Remove inline styling artifacts (`{.underline}`, stray Markdown anchors).
* Keep time-sensitive facts generic unless a date is required; avoid version numbers unless sourced per release notes.

### Prompt template

```
SYSTEM
You are a copy editor. Make only style-level changes—no new facts.

USER
STYLE_GUIDE
- Voice: neutral, concise, third person.
- Terminology: …
- Formatting rules: …

INPUT
[
  {"node_id":"…","element_id":"…","markdown":"…"},
  …
]

TASK
Perform light-touch edits for style/consistency. Do not add claims or change meaning. Fix artifacts.
Return only changed entries.

OUTPUT (JSON)
{
  "revisions": [
    {
      "node_id":"…",
      "element_id":"…",
      "markdown":"…"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Orchestration notes (how to wire it up)

* **Traversal plan**

  * **Phase 1 (BFS):** Feed one level at a time; apply decisions; physically move/merge/delete nodes before continuing deeper.
  * **Phase 2 (DFS):** Walk node-by-node with full path context; commit edits in place.
  * **Phase 3 (Sweep):** Batch by major section to keep style consistent.

* **Determinism & safety**

  * Enforce the **output JSON contract**. Reject/repair any reply that doesn’t validate.
  * Add “Do not invent new nodes/content\_refs” to every prompt.
  * Keep an **operation budget** per call (e.g., max 50 edits) to prevent runaway diffs.

* **Actions you’ll need to implement**

  * `apply_decisions()` for Stage 1 (handle MOVE/MERGE deterministically by node\_id).
  * `apply_content_edits()` for Stage 2.
  * `apply_style_revisions()` for Stage 3.

* **Confidence & review**

  * Use the returned `confidence` (Stage 2) to route low-confidence nodes to human review.
  * Track a simple **audit log**: node\_id, action, old→new hash.

* **Batching/tokens**

  * Stage 1: many nodes, tiny snippets.
  * Stage 2: one node at a time (or small batches) with full path.
  * Stage 3: by section; no structure.

---

## Quick example (Stage 1 decision for your sample)

You’d expect returns like:

```json
{
  "decisions": [
    {"node_id":"kubernetes-primer-miscellaneous-chapter-summary_ccf9acb9","action":"DELETE","reason":"chapter scaffolding"},
    {"node_id":"kubernetes-primer-miscellaneous_...star-trek-reference_a5b59442","action":"DELETE","reason":"trivia"},
    {"node_id":"kubernetes-primer_d8d41ccb:paragraph_this-cha_5b873e62","action":"DELETE","reason":"chapter meta"},
    {"node_id":"kubernetes-primer-miscellaneous_ca7bf52d:contact_block","action":"DELETE","reason":"personal promo/PII"},
    {"node_id":"kubernetes-primer-historical-context-industry-evolution-industry-needs_fb5839bf","action":"FLAG_EMPTY","reason":"empty leaf; keep only if intentional"}
  ]
}
```

*(If your implementation treats `content_refs` as separate units, you can allow Stage 1 to delete whole nodes only, and defer `content_refs` deletions to Stage 2.)*

---

## Optional: one “all-in-one” prompt (if you must)

If you prefer fewer round trips for small trees, combine Stage 1+2 but keep **two distinct output sections**: `structure_decisions` and `content_edits`. For larger or many trees, the three-prompt pipeline is more robust.

---

If you share your exact runner (CLI/script or tool), I can tailor these prompts to its arguments and return types, including edge cases like moving a node that itself has children and `content_refs`.
